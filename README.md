# qd-neurons
This project uses QD algorithms to optimize neuron-centric plasticity rules in artificial neural networks. Treating each neuron as an independent agent, it explores how neurons can cooperate in a multi-agent framework to solve tasks, shifting focus from synapse-level to neuron-level adaptability.
